       "'human: Hey, I\\'m Rakesh\\nassistant: Hello Rakesh. How are you today?\\nhuman: I have been feeling low recently\\nassistant: It can be tough to navigate those emotions. Would you like to talk more about what\\'s been going on and how you\\'ve been feeling? I\\'m here to listen.\\nhuman: Went through a really bad breakup\\nassistant: I\\'m so sorry to hear that, Rakesh. It can be really tough to deal with breakups. Would you like to talk more about what happened and how it made you feel? I\\'m here to listen.\\nhuman: I feel horrible and cheated\\nassistant: It sounds like you\\'re feeling really hurt and betrayed right now. Can you tell me more about what happened with your ex-partner? What specifically made you feel that way?\\nhuman: I never built trust with someone like this, and had broken my barriers for the person I love. But I got cheated on.\\nassistant: It can be really painful to feel like we\\'ve compromised our own boundaries or values when it comes to someone we care about.\\nhuman: It feels like everything was a lie. All the promises, all the plans we made—nothing was real. It just makes me feel like I was never enough.\\nassistant: I\\'m so sorry to hear that you\\'re feeling this way. It can be really painful to feel like our words and actions weren\\'t genuine. Can you tell me more about what happened with your partner? What specific promises or plans did they break, and how did it make you feel?\\nhuman: She promised we’d be together no matter what, that we’d always support each other. We talked about building a future together, but now I’m just left with broken promises and empty words. It feels like I was just a part of their plan when it suited them.\\nassistant: It sounds like you\\'re feeling a deep sense of betrayal and hurt from the breakup. Can you tell me more about what happened after you made your promises? How did they follow through on those commitments, and how has that affected you since then?\\nhuman: She promised we’d be together no matter what, that we’d always support each other. We talked about building a future together, but now I’m just left with broken promises and empty words. It feels like I was just a part of their plan when it suited them.\\nassistant: It sounds like you\\'re feeling a deep sense of betrayal and hurt from the breakup. Can you tell me more about what happened after you made your promises? How did they follow through on those commitments, and how has that affected you since then?\\nhuman: I did my parts,she did hers too. Ateast I thought she did until i found this out. I don\\'t know what to believe any more\\nassistant: It can be really tough when we\\'re trying to make sense of someone\\'s actions, and it sounds like you\\'re feeling a bit lost right now. Can you tell me more about what happened after you found out? How did she react, and how has that affected your feelings about the breakup overall?\\nhuman: They tried to deny it at first, but then admitted everything, and just shrugged it off like it wasn’t a big deal. It felt like all the things we shared, the trust I gave, meant nothing to them. I was just another person they could lie to.\\nassistant: It sounds like you feel like your trust and feelings were disregarded after the breakup. Can you tell me more about what happened when they admitted their infidelity? How did that make you feel in that moment?\\nhuman: In that moment, I felt numb, like my heart just stopped. I wanted to scream, to fight back, but I didn’t know how. I felt betrayed, not just by them, but by everything I believed in. It was like a part of me was taken away.\\nassistant: It\\'s like nothing can ever go back to the way it was. The weight of their actions feels crushing, and it\\'s hard to breathe when you\\'re still reeling from the shock.\\nhuman: It\\'s like nothing can ever go back to the way it was. The weight of their actions feels crushing, and it\\'s hard to breathe when you\\'re still reeling from the shock.\\nassistant: I\\'m so sorry to hear that Rakesh is feeling that way. It sounds like the pain of the breakup has been compounded by the realization that they let you down in such a significant way. Can you tell me more about what happened leading up to this point? How did you find out, and how did it affect you?\\nhuman:  I found out through a message I saw on their phone. It wasn’t even a conversation meant for me to find, but there it was. I felt like I was punched in the gut, and then when I confronted them, they barely seemed affected. They didn’t even apologize at first, just kind of brushed it off. It’s like my emotions didn’t matter at all.\\nassistant: It sounds like you\\'re feeling a deep sense of hurt and betrayal right now. Can you tell me more about what happened when you confronted them? How did they respond to your feelings and concerns?\\nhuman: They just seemed so distant, almost like they were detached from the situation. When I asked how they could do that to me, they just shrugged and said it was a mistake, something that didn\\'t mean anything. It felt like they were minimizing everything—like my pain, the trust I gave them—it all just didn’t matter. I never expected them to be so cold.\\nassistant: It sounds like you\\'re feeling hurt by their response, especially since you felt like your emotions and feelings mattered to them. Can you tell me more about what happened after they shrugged it off? How did you feel in that moment?\\nhuman: In that moment, I just felt empty. It was like all the warmth and connection we had was completely gone, replaced by this cold indifference. I couldn\\'t understand how someone I trusted so deeply could be so unaffected by my pain. I just wanted to walk away, but I also felt so lost—like I didn’t know who they really were anymore. It made me question everything about us.\\nassistant: It sounds like you\\'re feeling a deep sense of disconnection and confusion right now. Can you tell me more about what happened in that moment when you felt this way? How did it make you feel, and how has your perspective on the relationship changed since then?\\nhuman:  That moment felt like everything I thought I knew about the relationship crumbled in an instant. I couldn’t believe how different they seemed when the truth came out. It\\'s like the person I loved was replaced by someone I didn’t recognize. Since then, it\\'s been hard to trust anything that happened between us. It feels like I was just living in a fantasy. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to see our time together the same way again.\\nassistant: It sounds like you\\'re struggling to come to terms with the end of your relationship and feeling uncertain about how to process your emotions. Can you tell me more about what it\\'s like for you when you think back on those moments? What specific things do you remember feeling or thinking during that time?\\nhuman: When I look back, it’s like I remember all the little things that once felt so special, but now they just feel empty. I keep thinking about the moments when we laughed, when we talked about our future together, and how it all seemed so real at the time. But now, those memories just feel hollow. I start wondering if they were ever genuine, or if I was just fooling myself. It\\'s hard to even trust those moments anymore. Everything just feels tainted now.\\nassistant: It sounds like you\\'re struggling to reconcile the past with the present, and it\\'s affecting your ability to connect with memories that once felt so meaningful. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you question whether those moments were genuine or if you were just pretending?\\nhuman:  I guess it’s because of how they acted once everything came to light. All the affection, the promises, the \"we’re in this together\" moments—it feels like they were just words. How could they say all that and then turn around and betray me like this? It makes me wonder if I was just a part of their game, if all those good times were just a facade. It’s like I can’t separate the love I thought I had from the hurt I feel now. It’s all mixed together in a way that makes it hard to trust any of it was real.\\nassistant: It sounds like you\\'re struggling to reconcile the emotions and memories associated with the breakup, particularly the feelings of affection and promises made during the relationship. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you question whether those moments were genuine or if you were just pretending?\\nhuman: It\\'s just the way they dismissed everything after the fact. If it meant so much to them, why didn’t they fight for it? Why didn’t they care when I was hurting? It’s hard to understand how someone can go from being so loving to being so cold.\\nassistant: I\\'m so sorry to hear that you\\'re going through this. It\\'s understandable that you\\'re feeling hurt and confused about why your partner didn\\'t fight for you or care about your feelings after the breakup. Can you tell me more about what you mean by \"go from being so loving\" to being so cold? What specific actions or words made you feel that way?\\nhuman: Before everything came out, they were always so affectionate—constant reassurance, saying things like they couldn\\'t imagine their life without me, making plans for the future, and always wanting to be there for me. But after the truth came out, it was like all of that disappeared in an instant. They barely seemed to care when I confronted them, and they didn’t try to apologize or even show regret. They just seemed... empty.\\nassistant: It sounds like you\\'re feeling a sense of loss and disconnection from the person you loved.

Can you tell me more about what it means to you when they say things like \"we were in this together\" or \"I couldn\\'t imagine our life without you\"? How do those words make you feel now?\\nhuman: Those words used to mean everything to me. They felt like promises—like they saw a future with me, and that we were building something real together.

It\\'s hard to even remember them without feeling betrayed.\\nassistant: It sounds like the words \"we were in this together\" and \"I couldn\\'t imagine our life without you\" used to hold a special significance for you, but now they seem empty and unfulfilling.
